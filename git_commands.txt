 typical new work sequence in GIT:

 git clone url  //clone repository to your local machine
 git branch     //check the current active branch and list all other branches
 git log        //list all work log
 git status     //list status of current local repo
 git checkout -b new_branch_name   //create a new branch
 git add   //stage changes
 git commit  //commit changes
 git push --set-upstream origin new_branch_name //set remote tracking branch to the same as local branch
 // Don’t push directly to master

 git push  --set-upstream-to=origin/branch_name //push changes to upstream branch. before this command make sure that upstream set correcly.
 go to github.com and create a pull request
 git pull  // get changes from others, make sure that pulling from origin/master.
 do git pull periodically to ensure that you are up to date with other’s changes.
