 typical new work sequence in GIT:
 --------------------------------

 git clone url  //clone repository to your local machine
 git branch     //check the current active branch and list all other branches
 git log        //list all work log
 git status     //list status of current local repo
 git checkout -b new_branch_name   //create a new branch
 git push --set-upstream origin new_branch_name // set upstream branch same as local branch. Don’t push directly to master
 git add   //stage changes
 git commit  //commit changes
 git push  //push changes to upstream branch. before this command make sure that upstream set correcly.
 go to github.com and create a pull request
 Someone else do the merge
