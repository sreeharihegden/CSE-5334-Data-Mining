This includes contributor names, occupation and employer, address, and contribution amount. Specifically, we will be using the FEC data from 2012 election between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. This is widely considered as a landmark election as both sides spent an unprecedented amount of 1 Billion dollars each (i.e. more than 6000 Crores in INR each). If you are interested, you can download the entire list of contributor details at the [FEC site](http://www.fec.gov/disclosurep/PDownload.do). It is relatively large (150 MB compressed, 1 GB uncompressed). For our experiments, we will use a smaller subset of the data collected (and cleaned) by Wes McKinney (the creator of Pandas). For the download link, see the [Assignments page](http://saravanan-thirumuruganathan.github.io/cse5334Spring2015/assignments.html). It is small by most standards (around 1.4 million records, 20 MB compressed, 160 MB uncompressed) but large enough to give a taste of why data mining is compute intensive. Hopefully, this will also give you an appreciation as to the awesomeness of Pandas/Numpy - you can do really cool stuff with 2-3 lines of code that runs in seconds. \n",
